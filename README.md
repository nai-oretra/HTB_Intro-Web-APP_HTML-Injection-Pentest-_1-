First Pentest repport from Hack the Box Acamedy - Introduction to Web APP - HTML Injection

Experience Return 

From ME : 
First test of Pentest repport. it's not beautifull or good structurated but i think it's the good format. 
Informations like CVSS qualification it's for me not obligatory but it's cool to have them. On the next repport, i think it's good to give more détail to explain the reasons
of his vector.


From Other : 
*Trad from French to English with GTrad : *

Frankly for a first draft it's great! You describe each element well, and you add the evidence well via screns in your PoC
At the level of the frame you if you had several vulnerabilities you could have added a table classifying them not in order of severity too. 
But otherwise overall your model is what is expected to illustrate and highlight the results of a pentest so it's consistent!

Amelioration points : 
  . Read Template from professionnal repport 
  . Based my futur repport on the professionnal repport structure
  . Explain the CVSS Vector Choice 
  . Beautifull présentation
  . Correct the spelling 
  . Create an english version
  . Ohter ? :)
